Simple programs to experiment with sending binary data over micropython REPL.

- `chkbytes.py`: demonstrate sending int array, string, bytes out REPL with `print` and `sys.stdout`
- `fakerepltmit.py`: send binary data via REPL- arbitrary, for evaluation
- `readfake.py`: read binary data from (linux) serial port and disply
